I don't think I can agree with the view just expressed. There is no doubting reality TV shows have created a sensation. They have caused a big stir wherever they are shown.
However, I think this type of show should not be encouraged. There is a very strong element of material incentive in it. People in the shows compete against each other only for money. Since it is a large amount of money, each contestant tries to defeat others by every means. Money stirs up greed and fierce competition nurtures selfishness. These shows tend to bring out the worst side of human nature. Moreover, the behavior of the contestants may also affect viewers, especially young viewers, who may become money-centered as well. So such shows are doing more harm than good to society. It is just as the French protesters stated on their placard, "With trash TV people turn into idiots." I quite agree.
These shows are also doing harm to the contestants themselves. Stories are being circulated about what happened to them after they left the stage. To some of them, the party is over and troubles come along. A group of former contestants in the UK talked about suffering from emotional scarring. Others complained that their reputation and careers were harmed by the scenes that appeared to reveal a nasty side of their character.
